# README Generator

Create a polished and professional README file for your project with ease! 

## About the Project

This repository contains code for a Node.js-based README generator designed to help developers swiftly create a standardized README file. The following points describe what happens when a user runs the command "node index.js" in the terminal for this command-line application:

## How it works

The application prompts users for details about their project repository. As a result, a README.md file is produced, featuring the project's name as the title and including sections for the description, table of contents, installation, usage, contributing, tests, and questions.
Upon input of the project's title, the application adopts it as the README's heading.
The user's input for the description, installation procedures, usage tips, contribution rules, and test directions are incorporated into the respective sections of the README.
Selecting a license results in the inclusion of a corresponding license badge at the top of the README. Additionally, a segment in the README, titled 'License,' is populated with details about the chosen license's provisions.
The user's GitHub username is integrated into the 'Questions' section of the README, complete with a hyperlink to their GitHub profile.
The provision of a user's email address is also noted in the 'Questions' section, accompanied by directions for reaching out to the user for further inquiries.
Clicking on any link within the table of contents smoothly navigates to the respective section in the README.
